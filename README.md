Despite recent advances in quantum sciences, a quantum master equation that accurately and simply characterizes open quantum dynamics across extremely long timescales and in 
dispersive environments is still needed. In this study, we optimize the computation of the fourth-order time- convolutionless master equation to meet this need. Early versions 
of this master equation required computing a multidimensional integral, limiting its use. Our master equation accounts for simulta- neous relaxation and dephasing, resulting in 
coefficients proportional to the systemâ€™s spectral density over frequency derivative. In sub-Ohmic environments, this derivative induces infrared divergence in the master equation, 
invalidating the second-order Bloch-Redfield master equation findings. We analyze the approach to a ground state in a generic open quantum system and demonstrate that it is not 
reliably computed by the Bloch-Redfield equation alone. The optimized fourth-order equation shows that the ground-state approach is accurate to second order in bath coupling regardless 
of the dispersion, even though it can diverge in the fourth order.
